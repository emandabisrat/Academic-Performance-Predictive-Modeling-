## Project
This project aims to analyze and predict academic performance based on alcohol consumption patterns of students. We use K Means clustering, Random Forest, Predictive modeling, and create visualizations to effecitvely communicate our findings. 

## Background
It is widely known that alcohol consumption during an individual's adolescent years can negatively impact brain development and one’s ability to learn. This report presents a predictive modeling approach to understand whether alcohol has a greater influence on the parts of the brain involved with processing language versus mathematics. 

## Data Sources
The datasets utilized in this analysis are derived from Kaggle. The data for one of the datasets was gathered from a survey taken by students enrolled in a math class while the other dataset was taken by students enrolled in a Portuguese course. The data was collected in April of 2008 from secondary schools in Porto, Portugal, where the legal drinking age is 18, and has allowed for the exploration of interesting social, gender, and study information. It comprises anonymized student details, including demographics, levels of alcohol consumption, and performance in the classes.
